# GoShorten

This project spawned due to my curiousity in gRPC, golang, and building something practical to share.
___________________________
## What is GoShorten?
GoShorten is a self-hosted URL Shortener written in Golang.  It uses a gRPC server on the "backend" for API calls and stores data in a Redis Database.  The current Time-To-Live for each URL/Code is set for 5 minutes.
